# Introduction:

As a former job seeker, I was often struck by the lack of comprehensive data exploring the most optimal jobs and skills within the data science field. Driven by the desire to better understand which skills top employers are seeking and how they correlate with higher salaries, I set out to analyze job market trends and salary data. Through this project, I aimed to uncover valuable insights that would help professionals navigate their career paths more effectively and position themselves for success in the competitive data science industry.

# Background:

### The questions I wanted to answer through this project were:
1. Do more skills get you better pay?
2. What’s the salary for data jobs in different regions?
3. What are the top skills of data professionals?
4. What’s the pay for the top 10 skills?

### About the Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes real-world job data sourced from the field of data science, specifically focusing on salaries across various job titles, countries, and types of work. It includes key variables such as job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills, all of which are crucial for understanding salary trends and making informed career decisions. The dataset reflects salaries in different countries and regions, with a focus on providing median salary values, which offer a more stable and representative measure of typical earnings within each job category.

### Excel Skills Used:
The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:
- Pivot Table
- Pivot Charts
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query
- Power Pivot

### Insights:
There is a positive correlation between the number of skills requested in job postings and the median salary, especially in roles like Senior Data Engineer and Data Scientist, while positions that require fewer skills, such as Business Analyst, tend to offer lower salaries, suggesting that specialized skill sets are more highly valued. This trend emphasizes the importance of acquiring a diverse range of relevant skills, particularly for individuals aiming to secure higher-paying roles in the competitive job market.

# 2. What’s the salary for data jobs in different regions?

### Insights:
Job roles like Senior Data Engineer and Data Scientist command higher median salaries both in the US and internationally, reflecting the global demand for advanced data expertise. The salary disparity between US and non-US roles is particularly noticeable in high-tech positions, likely influenced by the concentration of tech industries in the US. These salary insights are crucial for planning and salary negotiations, as they help professionals and companies align their offers with market standards while accounting for geographical differences.

# 3. What are the top skills of data professionals?

Below is the data visualization I created to answer this question.

### Insights:
SQL and Python dominate as top skills in data-related jobs, reflecting their foundational role in data processing and analysis. Emerging technologies like AWS and Azure also show significant presence, highlighting the industry's shift towards cloud services and big data technologies. Understanding these prevalent skills not only helps professionals stay competitive but also guides training and educational programs to focus on the most impactful technologies.

# 4. What’s the pay of the top 10 skills?

Below is the data visualization I created to answer this question.

### Insights:
Higher median salaries are associated with skills like Python, Oracle, and SQL, indicating their critical role in high-paying tech jobs. In contrast, skills like PowerPoint and Word have the lowest median salaries and likelihood, reflecting less specialization and demand in high-salary sectors. This chart emphasizes the importance of investing time in learning high-value skills like Python and SQL, as they are closely tied to higher-paying roles, particularly for those aiming to maximize their salary in the tech industry.

# Conclusion:
### What I Learned:
In this project, I gained valuable experience using Excel tools to analyze and interpret data related to the data science job market. I deepened my understanding of PivotTables and PivotCharts, which allowed me to effectively summarize and visualize salary trends across job titles and regions. I also became proficient with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), which enabled me to perform advanced calculations. Additionally, using Power Query and Power Pivot, I learned how to efficiently transform and analyze large datasets, which was crucial for extracting meaningful insights. These Excel skills allowed me to break down complex data, build interactive reports, and make informed conclusions about the job market.

### Closing Thoughts:
The Excel skills I’ve acquired throughout this project will be essential for my future work as a data analyst. I can now apply Power Query and Power Pivot to automate data processing tasks, making my analysis more efficient and scalable. The ability to build advanced calculations using DAX will help me perform deeper analyses and uncover more nuanced insights. Going forward, I plan to use these skills to tackle more complex datasets and create impactful visualizations.
