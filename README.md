# Introduction

As a former job seeker, I’ve always been surprised by the lack of data exploring the most optimal jobs and skills in the data science market. I set out to understand what skills top employers request and how to land more pay.

### Questions to Analyze

To understand the data science job market, I asked the following:

1. **Do more skills get you better pay?**
2. **What’s the salary for data jobs in different regions?**
3. **What are the top skills of data professionals?**
4. **What’s the pay for the top 10 skills?**

### Excel Skills Used

The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:

- **📊 Pivot Tables**
- **📈 Pivot Charts**
- **🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **🔍 Power Query**
- **💪 Power Pivot**

### Data Jobs Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains real-world data science job information from 2023. The dataset is available via my Excel course, which provides a foundation for analyzing data using Excel. 

It includes detailed information on:

- **👨‍💼 Job titles**
- **💰 Salaries**
- **📍 Locations**
- **🛠️ Skills**

## 1️⃣ Do more skills get you better pay?

#### 💡 Insights

- 📈 There is a positive correlation between the number of skills requested in job postings and the median salary, particularly in roles like Senior Data Engineer and Data Scientist.
- 💼 Roles that require fewer skills, like Business Analyst, tend to offer lower salaries, suggesting that more specialized skill sets command higher market value.
